ME: Oh, hello, ELIZA.  It’s been a long time.

ELIZA: Hi. What seems to be your problem? 

ME: Lately, I’ve been feeling a little depressed.

ELIZA: And how do you feel right now? 

ME: I feel sad, but relieved to be writing.

ELIZA: Of what does feeling sad remind you? 

ME: Well, I’m an alcoholic, and I’ve been sober for a long time, but I drank
yesterday.  And then I decided to stop drinking again.  But still; that makes
me feel sad.

ELIZA: Is it because you are an alcoholic that you came to me?
