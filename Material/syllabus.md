### W1-3 Introduction: 5L 0T
1. Motivation + Paradigms: 1L
2. Quick Pascal: 2L
   1. Recursive set of expressions

   3. Recursive set of types
   4. Mutual recursion in nesting of procedures and functions
   5. Names, predefined, nesting
3. Principles: 0L
   1. Recursive Structures:
      - Atomics vs. Compound
      - Constructor and atoms
      - Mutually Recursive

      2. Expression vs. command vs. Statement
      3. Definition vs. Declaration
   4. The Collateral Confusion
      1. Sequential vs. Collateral Computation
      2. Definition vs. declaration vs. initialization
      3. Sequential vs. Recursive vs. Collateral definition   +/Pas : 3
4. Language Analysis Techniques
   1. Language Scope:
      - Vision and Price
      - Paradigm
      - Method of language definition 
   2. Execution
      - Hello World
      - Extent of program
      - Interpreted, P-System or Compiled
      - Where does the program start? How does it end
      - Library vs. predefined vs. lockedin 
   3. Concepts and names
       - Find the concepts: expression, threads, definition, labels,
         declaration, function, reference, traits, labels, macro, command,
         enumeration, procedure, class, type, module, template,
         monads,
       - Recursive relationship among concepts
       - Are they nameable? can they be anonymous? can they have
       multiple names?
5. **Values**: what values can the language manipulate? how close are they to the machine?
      1. Symbolic values:
          1. Strings: e.g., icon and Snobol
          2. S-Expression, e.g., the lisp family
          3. Trees, e.g., the lisp family
          4. Terms, e.g., Prolog
      2. Non symbolic values (will study with types)
          1. Primitive values; Virtual machine values, integers, points, colors, lines,
          2. Values composition
      3. Programmatic values:
          - functions aka closures aka labmda expressions
          - function objects such as iterators
          - co-routines
          - continuation

### Tutorial on D 2T
1. Lexical analysis 1T
    1. Methodology: identify the stages, identify the tokens, identify the meaning
    2. Stages of lexical processing:
        1. **Prepare**:
            1. **Remove** ignored characters
            2. **Separators**: find all separators and remove them
                1. **Characters**: space, newline and other spacing characters
                2. **Lines**: line comments
                3. **Chunks**: blocks comments either Nested/Unnested/Escapeable
        2. **Tokenize**: using regular expressions
        3. **Analyze**: characetrize and parse
    3. **Analysis I: Categories of tokens**:
        1. **Literals**: mean themselves, no need to create before using, string, integer, real
        2. **Identifier**/*name*, e.g.,`a101` or `foo2`, defined by RE, e.g.,
           `[a-zA-Z_$][a-zA-Z_$0-9]*`, used by programmers to refer to *entities*.
        3. **Keyword**/*reserved word*: token matching Identifier RE, but cannot be used as name
        4. **Punctuation**: e.g, `;` `,` `()
        5. **Operators**: e.g. `+`, `<<<`, `<=`
    4. **Analysis II: Meaning of tokens**: what do they denote?
        1. **Comments**: denote nothing
        2. **Punctuation**: Do not provide content. How to parse and organize informational tokens
        3. **Informational**: provide contents
            1. **Literal**: provides itself
            2. **Identifier**: provides this which it identifies
                1. **Free**: available, clean to programmer
                2. **Predefined**: can be redefined by programmer
                3. **reserved identifier**: cannot be redefined by user
            3. **Operator**: identify an operator; possibly overload-able.
        4. **Meaning of keywords**: sometimes any of the above, sometimes none, sometimes it depends.
            1. **Punctuation + Keyword**: e.g., `begin`, `var`, `record`, `of`, `array`, `if`, `return`
               **Contextual Punctuation Keyword ** e.g., override in C++, is keyword in some contexts, but not in others
            2. **Literal + Keyword**:  reserved identifier of special values, e.g., and mainly `true`, `false`, `null`; more correctly,
            3. **Identifier + Keyword**: reserved identifier of value, type, variable, function, ...
            4. **Operator + Keyword** e.g., `or`/`and` / `mod` / `new`/
            5. **Unused Keywords**
                1. **Reserved Keyword** for future e.g., entry in early C, later dropped
                2. **Deprecated Keyword** used in the past, e.g., delete in D; frowned upon now
                3. **Forbidden Keyword** never used, never will be used, e.g, const and goto in java, to protect against
                   mistakes, denote nothing
2. tokens of D example: 1T
3. Optional: **Other Lexical Perspectives**
    1. Block open/closing
    2. Separatist/Terminist/Permissive/Mixed
    3. Case
    4. Lexical Conventions
    5. Escaping
